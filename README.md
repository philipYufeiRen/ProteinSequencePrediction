This project is dedicated to the task of predicting the secondary structure of proteins
from their primary sequences, which plays an important role in drug discovery
and structural biology. Given that the determination of a proteinâ€™s 3D structure
through X-ray crystallography or Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a costly
and time-intensive process, our goal is to develop a deep learning model capable
of accurately inferring secondary structures in a more efficient manner, finally
enhancing the computational determination of protein structures. Our proposed
approach utilizes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with bi-directional Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units, specifically designed to handle sequential data
and capture the long-range dependencies between amino acids which are vital
for accurate structure prediction. The result of our study shows that around 55%
accuracy in both training and validating is achieved using bi-directional LSTM
model with the model structure under Model Architecture section of our report.
